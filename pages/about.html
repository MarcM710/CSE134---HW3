        <p>Hi, I'm Marc Mendoza. I am a 4th year Computer Science major at UC San Diego 
        who is currently working at a startup Fintech company called Ava Finance. I am currently working 
        solely on backend web development, however I plan on migrating towards working on the front end as well
        and becoming a full stack web developer. </p>
